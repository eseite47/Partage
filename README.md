# Partage

Partage is a simple chrome extension that allows you to easily share links with friends and family without navigating away from the tabs you are browsing. Instead, you can now simply send and receive links by opening the Partage popup, located in the top right corner of your browser.

Partage was developed as part of a 4 day hackathon at FullStack Academy in New York City, September 2017.

## Download Partage

Partage will soon be available on the Chrome Web Store.

For the moment, you may download this code, unxip it, and upload it to your extensions by clicking the developer mode in the upper right corner of your screen.
